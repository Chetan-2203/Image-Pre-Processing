# Image-Pre-Processing
1. Exp1a:- Image Resizing-Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
2. Exp1b:- Image Rotation-Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor.
3. Exp1c:- Image Translation-Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
